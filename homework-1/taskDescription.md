The following homework is to be done individually. The outcome to be submitted is a single zip-file containing exactly two R-files, one PDF file, one PNG file and one .RProj file.
Create an R-project to solve the following task:

1. Reproduce using solely base R the plots in the file EMPR_02_DataSummaries. You can improve the quality of these plots by labeling the axis and  plots accordingly, adding some colors and/or changing the shape of points. Collects of these plots in a single PDF document.
2. I would like to have a plot that show the association between the engine displacement and the city mileage of the cars in ggplots::mpg. The shape and color of the points should display the class. Explain whether it is useful to use color and shape. The plot should include the line of best fit of the mileage on engine displacement. Export/save your plot as png.

`1.` and `2.` should be solved in two different R files. Zip the directory containing these R files together with the PDF file of `1.` and the PNG file of `2.` as well as the `.Rproj` file and upload this single zip file as your solution.
